# My VUE ToDo app

## Note
The way i develop this: default vue debug server that runs on :8080 and express server that runs on :1337

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
Backend:
```
node index.js
```
Frontend:
```
npm run serve
```

### Production running
Build VUE app:
```
npm run build
```
Run the server:
```
node index.js
```
Mb that's not a good idea to do it "this" way, but for the first time i think i can:)
